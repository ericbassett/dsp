[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)
# Exercise 4.2  
---
The numbers generated by **random.random** are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.  
  
Generate 1000 numbers from **random.random** and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

# Imports
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import thinkstats2
import nsfg
import thinkplot
import random
```

# Generate 1000 random number list
```python
#Put 1000 random numbers in rand1000
rand1000=[]
for i in range(1000):
    rand1000 += [random.random()]
```

# Plot PMF
```python
#Make pmf of random values
rand_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand1000, label='random #s')
thinkplot.Pmfs([rand_pmf])
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='random #', ylabel='probability')
```

# Plot CDF
``` python
#Make cdf of random values
rand_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand_pmf, label='random #s')
thinkplot.Cdf(rand_cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='random #', ylabel='cdf')
```

# Conclusion
---
The distribution is uniform because the CDF is ~linear.
